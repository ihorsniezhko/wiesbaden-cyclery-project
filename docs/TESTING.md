### Lighthouse Summary

**Key Findings:**

- **Performance:** Consistently high scores - Optimized assets and efficient loading
- **Best Practices:** Strong adherence to web standards and security
- **SEO:** Strategic implementation - Content pages indexed, utility pages excluded

**SEO Strategy:**
The lower SEO scores on Shopping Cart, Checkout, and Create Account pages are **intentional and correct**. These pages use `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">` to prevent search engine indexing because:
- They contain user-specific, temporary content
- They have no SEO value or search intent
- Indexing them would waste crawl budget
- Users landing on these pages from search would be confused

See [SEO Implementation](seo.md) for complete details on the indexing strategy.

## Key Takeaways

- **Core functionality**: Fully tested and working
- **User workflows**: Complete and functional
- **Payment system**: Integrated and operational

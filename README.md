## 📝 Development Notes

### Naming Convention Evolution

**Note**: During early development, some commit messages and documentation used "Task X" instead of "Stage X" naming convention. This inconsistency exists in the Git history for the following:

- **Commit Messages**: Some commits for Stage 6 (Stripe Payment Integration) use "Task 6" in commit messages
- **GitHub Issues**: All issues have been standardized to use "Stage X" naming
- **Documentation**: All current documentation uses "Stage X" naming

**Going Forward**: All future commits, issues, and documentation will consistently use the "Stage X" naming convention. This demonstrates a real-world scenario where naming conventions evolve during project development, and Git history preservation takes precedence over perfect consistency.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run Django tests
python manage.py test

# Check for issues
python manage.py check
```
